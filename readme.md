Text descriptions of a human face were fed to a conditional GAN to produce an image that matches that description.

The ColorFeret dataset was used. Only the front profile pictures were preserved and trained on.
We aimed to build an application that could function as a forensic artist. 
The images were all manually labelled, and the text is provided here.
